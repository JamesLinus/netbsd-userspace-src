xen-nblibc
==========

A libc to be used on top of
[rumpuser-xen](https://github.com/anttikantee/rumpuser-xen).
Unless you really know what you're doing, it's best to use the
contents of this repo only via rumpuser-xen.

The ultimate target is to merge support back into the NetBSD libc and
make this repo superfluous.
